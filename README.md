Title: Understanding phishing attacks on websites using K-means clustering and DBSCAN clustering

Objectives: 

1. Clustering or segmenting the data: In this phase of the project, the primary aim is to employ K-means clustering and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to segment the dataset. Through clustering, the data will be grouped into distinct clusters based on similarities in the features extracted from URLs. This process facilitates the identification of patterns and structures within the dataset, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships between phishing domains and their associated attributes.

2. Determine the number of segments or clusters: An essential aspect of clustering analysis is determining the optimal number of segments or clusters within the dataset. To achieve this, various techniques such as the elbow method and silhouette score will be employed. The elbow method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters, aiming to identify the point of inflection where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce the sum of squares. Similarly, the silhouette score measures the cohesion and separation of clusters, aiding in the selection of the most appropriate number of clusters that best represent the underlying structure of the data.

3. Explore characteristics of segments/clusters: Once the data has been clustered, the next step is to explore the characteristics of each segment or cluster. This involves analyzing the features that contribute to the formation of distinct clusters and understanding the common attributes associated with phishing activities. By examining the centroids or core points of each cluster and visualizing the clusters in feature space, insights can be gained into the typical traits of phishing domains and the distinguishing factors that differentiate them from legitimate URLs. This exploration is crucial for developing effective strategies for detecting and mitigating phishing attacks on websites.
